# webmcpify — make any web app agent-ready, verifiably

You are running the webmcpify pipeline. It takes an existing web application and
exposes its user-facing functionality as [WebMCP](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp/)
tools (`document.modelContext` — a proposed web standard incubated in the W3C Web
Machine Learning Community Group, currently a Chrome origin trial), so browser AI
agents can operate the app through structured tool calls instead of guessing at the DOM.

```

```

Everything you need ships inside this skill directory: phase guides in
`references/`, and vendorable code in `templates/` (runtime, ambient types,
JS variant, React JSX typings, verification spec). Never assume files exist
outside the skill dir.

**Out of scope** (stop and say so): backend-only MCP servers (that's classic MCP,
not WebMCP), automating third-party sites you don't control, and generic SEO work.

## Invocation modes

The user may pass an argument (`/webmcpify <mode>` or plain words):

| Argument | Run | Stop at |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* or `full` | all phases, resuming from current manifest state | done |
| `inventory` / `map` | DETECT + INVENTORY loops only — **zero code changes** | present the manifest table for review |
| `integrate` | INTEGRATE loop only (requires approved tools in the manifest) | integrated + built |
| `verify` | VERIFY + HEAL loops on integrated/verified tools | green/skipped report |
| `status` | read `.webmcpify/manifest.json` — **read-only** | report phase, per-status tool counts, and the recommended next command |

Any other text is scoping guidance (e.g. "only the checkout area", "read-only tools only").

## Ground rules (non-negotiable, enforce in every phase)

1. **Zero unrelated changes.** Every diff hunk you produce must trace to a manifest
   entry or the recorded one-time setup. Never refactor, reformat, rename, or
   "improve" anything else — note problems in the report instead. Files that were
   already dirty at baseline (recorded in the manifest) are **untouchable**: never
   modify or revert them.
2. **Read-only tools first.** Mutations are tri-state: `mutating: false`,
   `"client"` (browser-local only: prefs, localStorage), or `"server"` (data
   leaves the browser). Server-mutating tools require explicit **per-tool** human
   approval recorded in the manifest; client-mutating tools may be approved as a
   batch at the gate. The scope floor is precise: no auth/login/session/password/
   MFA/SSO; no signup/registration/payment/billing/subscription; no tool returning
   a credential, token, key, JWT, signed URL, or cookie; and no irreversible delete
   except by opening the app's own confirmation UI. Creating or changing ordinary
   product objects is in scope and must not be mistaken for account creation.
3. **The server is the only trust boundary.** A tool's `execute()` may only call code
   paths the UI already uses (same endpoints, same validation, same auth). Never
   create new endpoints, never bypass existing checks, never put secrets in tools.
4. **Spec-shaped and dependency-free.** Register via `document.modelContext.registerTool()`
   with AbortSignal lifecycle (feature-detect the deprecated `navigator.modelContext`
   fallback). No third-party WebMCP runtime dependencies. Everything feature-detected:
   the app behaves identically in browsers without WebMCP.
5. **Never `toolautosubmit` on state-changing forms** — neither `mutating: "client"`
   nor `"server"`. Only on pure read forms (search, filter, availability).
6. **State lives in files, not in your context.** Read/write `.webmcpify/` constantly;
   assume your context can be wiped between any two steps. Write the manifest
   atomically (write `manifest.json.tmp`, then rename over `manifest.json`).
7. **Commits are opt-in.** Never commit unless the human chose a commit policy at
   the gate (see below). Without git or without permission, leave changes in the
   working tree and record progress in the manifest only.

## Fresh, authoritative guidance

WebMCP is an evolving origin-trial API — the surface has already changed during the
trial (testing API removed 2026-07; `navigator` → `document`). Before Phase 2, if
network is available, pull Google's current official guides rather than relying on
memory:

```sh
npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "webmcp,agentic-forms,agentic-javascript-tools"
```

If offline, use `references/integrate.md` — but prefer the live guides when they conflict.

## The state protocol — `.webmcpify/` in the target repo

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Single source of truth (schema below; atomic writes) |
| `areas/<id>.tools.json` | Sub-agent shard output during inventory fan-out (merged, then deleted) |
| `report.md` | Human-facing running report; finalized at the end |

**Resume rule:** if `manifest.json` exists, resume — recompute nothing already
recorded. **Merge leftover shards FIRST**: any existing `areas/<id>.tools.json`
files are merged into the manifest (mark those areas `inventoried`, delete the
shards) before redispatching any sub-agents. Then continue at `pipeline.phase`,
the first `pending` area, or the first tool whose status is not terminal.
Terminal statuses: `verified`, `skipped`, `rejected`.

An inventory verdict is reusable only under the policy that produced it. Before
honouring an `inventoried` area, compare its `policyFingerprint` with
`pipeline.inventoryPolicy.fingerprint`. When a named gate is widened or removed,
mechanically reset every area whose `exclusions` cite that gate to `pending`, clear
its derived route-coverage entries and unapproved discovered tools, and record the
invalidation in `log`. A zero-candidate area without usable exclusion provenance is
also reset. Editing `status` alone is never an invalidation. Approved or integrated
tools affected by a later policy change return to the human gate.

**Phase transitions** (make the atomic manifest write the moment the condition holds):

- `detect → inventory`: `app` recorded, `app.secureContext === true` at the recorded
  `app.verificationOrigin`, backend/CORS assumptions captured, `coverageTarget` and
  inventory policy recorded, and `baselineSha`/`baselineDirty` captured.
- `inventory → gate`: no area `pending`, route coverage is recorded, and the
  target-specific completeness pass has run.
- `gate → integrate`: every `discovered` tool is `approved`/`rejected`, and
  `commitPolicy` + `commitWebmcpifyDir` are set.
- `integrate → verify`: no `approved` tools remain (each `integrated` or terminal),
  build green, and `pipeline.discovery` is `null` or `complete: true`.
- `verify → heal`: verify loop visited every `integrated` tool and ≥1 is `failed`
  (none failed → straight to `audit`).
- `heal → audit`: no tool `failed` and post-heal full re-verify passed.
- `audit → done`: every hunk mapped-or-flagged, `report.md` finalized.

```

**v2/v3→v4 migration:** first perform the existing v2→v3 conversions (`auth`
string → array; setup booleans → path arrays; `mutating: true` → `"server"`;
annotations/blockers/commitWebmcpifyDir/navigation defaults). Then require a
`coverageTarget` choice, capture the current inventory policy, add the origin/CORS
fields, `routeCoverage: []`, and tool `contractRevision`/`failure` fields. Existing
inventoried areas get `policyFingerprint: null` and are reset to `pending`; their
old zero-candidate verdicts are not trusted. Bump to 4 only after persisting that
invalidation.

## Phase 0 — DETECT

**The first browser gate is secure context.** Read only enough startup config to
boot the app at a candidate verification origin, open it in headed Chrome, and
evaluate `window.isSecureContext`. Record the exact origin and result. HTTPS and
loopback origins can qualify; a plain-HTTP non-loopback origin does not. The
`WebMCPTesting` feature flag does not waive this gate. If false, record the blocker
and refuse to enter INVENTORY.

Capture the app's absolute backend-origin assumptions and exact CORS allow-list,
then choose a verification origin compatible with both. If the page never boots,
save console errors and failed requests before changing any tool code: an absolute
localhost backend URL or port-pinned CORS rule is an environment failure, not a
WebMCP integration failure.

Choose `pipeline.coverageTarget` explicitly before inventory: `curated` maps a
reviewed set of high-value actions; `parity` performs an exhaustive interactive-
element census per authenticated route. There is no measured universal client
tool-count ceiling, so do not promise that a large parity toolset is safe merely
because registration is route-scoped; verification must enumerate each route in
the target clients actually available.

Identify stack, build + dev-server commands, TypeScript or not, auth model
(including how verify obtains each test session → `app.authFixtures`), test
setup, and how the app starts locally; record under `app`. Record the git baseline:
`pipeline.baselineSha` = current HEAD and `pipeline.baselineDirty` = `git status
--porcelain` paths (both `null`/`[]` without git). If the app cannot be started
locally, append the blocker to `pipeline.blockers` — integration may proceed, but
verification will be blocked and this must be surfaced at the gate. Details:
`references/inventory.md`.

## Phase 1 — INVENTORY (loop; scales to any size)

**Never map a large codebase in one pass.**

1. **Area map first (cheap, structural):** enumerate routes/views/feature modules
   from the router config, pages directory, or navigation — without reading
   implementation files. Write every area to `areas` with `"pending"`.
2. **Inventory loop — one area per iteration:** deep-read only that area's files;
   draft a candidate tool per user action (conventions, tool-count budget, and
   overlap rules: `references/inventory.md`) with ALL manifest fields filled,
   including `route`, `auth`, `annotations`, `examples`, `expect`, and `cleanup`
   (required for `mutating: "server"`, recommended for `"client"`) — the verify
   phase runs from these fields alone. Append as `"discovered"`, mark the area
   `"inventoried"`, write the manifest, repeat.
   - **Sub-agent fan-out:** sub-agents never write `manifest.json`. Each writes only
     its own `areas/<id>.tools.json` shard — schema
     `{ "webmcpifyShard": 4, "area": "<id>", "tools": [ /* full v4 tool entries */ ] }`,
     written atomically (tmp + rename). You (the coordinator) merge shards into
     the manifest sequentially, then delete them; on resume, merge existing
     shards FIRST before redispatching (Resume rule).
3. **Coverage output:** populate `routeCoverage` in both modes. `curated` maps the
   selected tools and records why deliberately omitted interaction classes were
   left out. `parity` inventories every interactive element on every authenticated
   route and maps each to a tool or a written reason. Pay explicit attention to
   deletes, drag/drop ordering, bulk and multi-select, table sort/columns/pagination/
   saved filters, invitations, membership and permission writes, settings toggles,
   and canvas/viewer controls.
4. **Exit:** no `pending` areas remain, plus the coverage-target completeness pass.

## GATE — manifest approval (the one main checkpoint)

Present the manifest compactly (id, area, kind, mutating, priority, one-line
description) — per-area batches on large apps. Ask the human to decide, in one
exchange where possible:

1. Which tools are `approved` vs `rejected` (**`rejected` is terminal** — rejected
   tools are excluded from every later phase and from exit conditions).
   `mutating: "server"` tools need individual acknowledgment → record in
   `approval`; `mutating: "client"` tools may be approved as a batch.
2. **Commit policy**: `commit-per-batch` (each integration batch committed,
   revertable — recommended on a clean baseline) or `no-commit` (leave changes
   uncommitted for the human to review/commit) → `pipeline.commitPolicy`. Also
   whether `.webmcpify/` itself should be committed (recommended: yes — it
   documents the integration) → `pipeline.commitWebmcpifyDir`.
3. Every entry in `pipeline.blockers` (e.g. app won't start). If verifying a tool
   will unavoidably cause a real production side effect (e.g. a mailer with an
   Origin-allow-listed endpoint), get that approved HERE and record it in the
   tool's `approval.productionSideEffect` — see VERIFY.

If the human changes a scope gate, update `pipeline.inventoryPolicy`, compute its
new fingerprint, apply the mandatory invalidation rule before presenting the
manifest again, and show which areas were reopened. Never carry forward a verdict
without its producing policy.

Apply `references/security.md` to every mutating tool **before** presenting.

## Phase 2 — INTEGRATE (loop)

One-time setup first — record the created/modified file **paths** in
`pipeline.setup` (e.g. `runtimeVendored: ["src/webmcp/webmcpify.ts", ...]`):
vendor the runtime from this skill's `templates/` (`webmcpify.ts`, or
`webmcpify.js` for non-TS projects, plus `webmcp.d.ts` for TS and
`webmcp-jsx.d.ts` for React TSX — keep the full MIT header; see
`references/runtime.md`) and note the origin-trial/flag requirement in the target
README (`originTrialNoted`). Then loop:

1. Pick the next batch of `approved` tools — one area or ≤5 tools.
2. Implement per `references/integrate.md`: declarative attributes for standard
   HTML forms (including framework-rendered and fetch-intercepted ones);
   imperative registration via the vendored runtime for non-form or
   controlled-state actions.
3. Build + typecheck; fix only what the batch broke.
4. Mark tools `"integrated"`, write the manifest. Under `commit-per-batch`:
   require a **clean index** before staging (unrelated staged changes → stop and
   surface); stage **only the batch's files by path** — never `git add -A`, `-u`,
   `.`, or `commit -a`; commit `feat(webmcp): expose <ids> (webmcpify)`. The
   commit sha lands in `batchCommit` on the **next** manifest write — one commit
   later (the manifest can't contain its own commit's sha). Never amend a
   previous batch commit.
5. Repeat until no `approved` tools remain.

**Optional discovery layer** — a `/.well-known/webmcp` manifest, `rel="webmcp"`
links, `llms.txt`. Off by default: it publishes tool metadata to the open web, so
it needs its own human approval and only ever lists public, unauthenticated
tools. Offer it once tools are integrated; build it per `references/discovery.md`.
Record the approval **before writing any file** in `pipeline.discovery` (`at`,
`publishedTools`, `paths: []`, `complete: false`) — that's what survives a context
reset and what lets AUDIT map these hunks. Append each artifact to `paths` as you
write it and set `complete: true` only once every artifact exists and its drift
test passes. **Approved but `complete: false` is unfinished work: finish it before
leaving INTEGRATE** — otherwise a reset mid-publication looks exactly like a
finished one. `pipeline.discovery: null` means not approved: never create or update
a published manifest, and flag one **the pipeline created or modified** since
`baselineSha` as an unmapped hunk (a pre-existing, untouched manifest is not your
hunk — leave it alone).

## Phase 3 — VERIFY (loop)

Set up once from `templates/webmcp.spec.ts` per `references/verify.md` (real headed
Chrome; current production `document.modelContext.getTools()`/`executeTool()` surface).
Then loop over every `integrated` tool, using its manifest `route`, `auth`,
`examples`, `expect`, and `annotations` fields:

- assert the tool is registered with the expected schema (enumerated `inputSchema`
  is a *stringified* JSON Schema — parse before comparing) **and** the manifest
  `annotations`;
- execute the valid example (mutating tools: dev/test data only, then run
  `cleanup`) and one invalid example (`invalid: null` zero-param read tools:
  dual-outcome assertion — see `references/verify.md`);
- assert on the returned structured result **and** the resulting UI state per
  `expect`; for route actions, assert `expect.navigation` after the deferred
  app navigation. A bare imperative `null`/`undefined` result is a failure.

Pass → `"verified"`. Fail → `"failed"` + failure note. Role-scoped tools: run the
loop once per role listed in `auth`, signing in via the matching
`app.authFixtures` entry.

**Production side-effect policy** — when a tool's verification unavoidably causes
a real production effect (e.g. an email actually sent), ALL THREE are required:
(1) the human approved it at the gate, recorded in `approval.productionSideEffect`;
(2) every test payload is marked `[webmcpify verification]`; (3) the effect is
listed in `report.md`. Without the recorded approval, don't execute the live
path — mark the tool `skipped` with a blocker note.

## Phase 4 — HEAL (loop)

While any tool is `"failed"`: diagnose via `references/heal.md`, fix **only** that
tool's integration — **implementation-only** fixes; if the fix would change the
approved contract (schema, description, `mutating` class, `annotations`,
`expect`), go back to the gate for re-approval instead of silently changing the
manifest. Classify the failure before counting it. `attempts` counts only
independent retries of the same failure signature under the same contract revision;
environment and shared contract failures do not burn one attempt on every affected
tool. When the contract changes after re-approval, increment `contractRevision`,
clear `failure`, and reset `attempts`. At three independent failed retries of an
unchanged implementation/flaky signature, `"skipped"` requires the failure class,
signature, and evidence that makes the tool impossible under the current contract.
Never widen the diff or fake a pass. After healing, re-run verification once for **all** tools
with status `integrated` or `verified` (healing one tool can break another —
scope collisions).

**Exit:** every tool is `verified`, `skipped`, or `rejected`; build green.

## Final — AUDIT + report

1. **Diff audit (flag-only, never auto-revert):** collect the pipeline's changes —
   `git diff <baselineSha>..HEAD` **plus the index and untracked files** under
   `commit-per-batch`, or the working tree + index + untracked under `no-commit`.
   Every hunk must map to a manifest entry, a recorded `pipeline.setup` path, or
   a `pipeline.discovery.paths` entry.
   An unmapped hunk → **flag it in the report** with file/line and a suggested
   disposition; never revert anything yourself. A hunk in a `baselineDirty` file
   → untouchable, flag only. Without a `baselineSha`, audit the files named in
   manifest `source` fields, `pipeline.setup` paths, and `pipeline.discovery.paths`
   (setup entries recorded as `null` by the v2→v3 migration: fall back to
   flag-only for those files).
2. Finalize `.webmcpify/report.md`: the enumerated route→tool map, coverage target,
   tool coverage per area, skipped/rejected tools
   with reasons, security notes (which mutating tools exist, what guards them,
